# KineScribe: Hybrid Edge-LLM Framework for Fall Detection

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Work in Progress**: This project is currently under active development.

KineScribe is a robust fall detection system that combines the speed of on-device edge computing with the analytical power of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). This hybrid architecture provides rapid initial detection at the edge while leveraging cloud-based AI to eliminate false positives and generate context-rich, human-readable alerts for informed emergency response.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Real-time edge detection** using YOLOv8 pose estimation on Raspberry Pi
- **AI-powered verification** via multimodal LLM (Google Gemini) to reduce false positives
- **Context-aware alerting** with structured JSON output for emergency responders
- **High accuracy**: 85.25% mAP50, 84.90% precision on test set

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The detection and alert process consists of four key stages:

### 1. Real-Time Edge Detection (Raspberry Pi)

A lightweight YOLOv8 pose estimation model runs continuously on a Raspberry Pi, analyzing video feeds in real-time.

- **Low-Latency Analysis**: Immediate pose data extraction from video feed
- **Smart Triggering**: Detects fall-indicative postures using keypoint heuristics
- **Frame Capture**: Captures and forwards suspicious frames for verification

### 2. Multimodal LLM Verification (GenAI)

Potential fall frames are sent to a multimodal LLM (e.g., Google Gemini) for advanced analysis.

- **Contextual Understanding**: Evaluates both posture and surrounding scene context
- **False Positive Reduction**: Distinguishes between actual falls and benign situations (e.g., lying on a bed vs. fallen on the floor)
- **Intelligent Decision-Making**: Provides high-confidence fall confirmation

### 3. Context-Rich Alerting

Upon LLM confirmation, the system generates human-readable, structured alerts with actionable information.

### 4. LLM Inference and Alert Format

The system outputs structured JSON alerts that can be easily parsed by downstream applications.

**Example Alert Output:**
```json
{
  "fall_detected": true,
  "context": "A person is lying on their back on the carpeted floor of an office, with knees bent and arms near their head.\nThey appear unresponsive; the cause of the fall is estimated to be a medical event or accidental trip.",
  "bleeding_observed": false,
  "person_condition": "unresponsive",
  "confidence": 90.0
}
```

## üìä Performance Metrics

The YOLOv8 edge model was trained on a pseudo-labeled dataset and achieved the following results on the test set:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **mAP50** | 85.25% |
| **mAP50-95** | 51.32% |
| **Precision** | 84.90% |
| **Recall** | 77.48% |
| **F1 Score (fall class)** | 81.02% |

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kinescribe.git
cd kinescribe

```

### Usage

1. **Train the Edge Model**: Run `FallDetection_ModelTraining.ipynb` to train or fine-tune the YOLOv8 model
2. **Generate Pseudo-Labels** (optional): Use `FallDetection_PseudoLabelling.ipynb` to create additional training data
